# Live Cursors App ☝️

This is a simple, real-time app that shares the cursors of all currently connected users using web sockets. I was unable to deploy the web socket server so if you want to check out how this looks, feel free to follow the getting started guide.

## Technologies Used

- React JS
- Node JS
- Web Sockets

## Getting Started

First, fork and clone this repository. Then, navigate to the root folder and the backend folder separately, and run `npm install` in each of them. Once the dependencies are installed, navigate to the backend folder and execute `npm start`. Finally, return to the root folder and run `npm start`. You can now access the app by visiting localhost in your browser. Simply input a username into the form, and you're good to go.
